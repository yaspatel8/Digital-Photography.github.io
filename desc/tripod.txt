Aluminum
Oben’s durable aluminum tripod is ideal for the photographer on the go. It offers rock solid support wherever you set up, is easy to carry, and can take a beating when you’re on the go.

3-Secton Tripod
The lightweight and durable aluminum tripod features 3-section telescoping legs secured by flip locks. This Skysill tripod folds up to a compact 28.8 inches.

Interchangeable Feet
Your Skysill tripod will hold firmly to whatever surface you put it on. The rubber feet are great for preventing slipping on hard and highly polished surfaces, like a gym floor. They’re easy to remove and exchange for the spiked feet, which are steady and won’t slip or move on soft ground, grass, or sand.

Reversible Center Column
The center column is secured by a locking collar for easy height adjustment. When it’s reversed, the center column lets you place your camera right next to the ground for incredible macro and low-angle photography.

mproved ergonomics make operating the tripod more comfortable and seamless. Additional 1/4”-20 sockets along the outside of the tripod’s apex allow you to attach optional accessories and shoulder-strap mounts. The Mark 2 Tripod legs are easier to adjust and hold up better to the elements. Redesigned twist-locks prevent grit and debris from contaminating the threads. We added a vent at the top of each leg to allow efficient air transfer when extending or collapsing, for rapid deployment, and takedown.

To enable slow shutter speeds to be used to record movement in subjects such as waterfalls, clouds, cars, etc
To decrease depth of field by allowing wider apertures to be used, which helps separate subjects from their background
To decrease the effective ISO of high speed film (ie: above ISO400) and allow it to be used outdoors in bright situations
To allow video cameras (which have fixed shutter speeds) to film subjects such as snow, sand or other bright scenes which would normally cause overexposure

Product Type: Neutral Density Filters
PRO ND filters reduce the amount of light through the effect of glass-deposition film
This product is imported from USA - It is a 100% genuine product
PRO ND100,200,500,and 1000 provide dimming effects in aperture steps of 6.7,7.7,9 and 10,respectivity.Use them to create a slow shutter effect

The Cokin 67 x 67mm 0.9 Neutral Density 154 Filter is a solid ND filter providing a 3 stop exposure reduction. This 0.9 density creates a darkening of the entire image, allowing you to photograph with a wider aperture or slower shutter speed than normally required. By slowing your exposure time or increasing your aperture, you are able to control depth of field and convey movement more easily. Neutral density filters do not affect the coloration of the image and are ideal for pairing with other filters

You are able to decrease depth of field by using wider apertures,

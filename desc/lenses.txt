An STM motor allows smooth, quiet AF while a Lens Control Ring gives intuitive control over settings. Pleasing bokeh is achieved thanks to a bladeless, F11 aperture

reviews

I have only had this RF 600mm f/11 STM (N) lens for a few days now. I purchased it based on several reviews from a different site. In my opinion, It is a decent entry level prime zoom lens. The box it came in was slightly damaged, but the lens was well protected and there was no damage to the lens itself.


I received the lens today and have only done a few shots but I am liking what I am seeing. I will update this review after I have used it for a while.
Unfortunately the price and the long focal length will attract a lot of people who will not know how to use it because they don't understand the basics of photography. If you cannot clearly define reciprocity as it relates to photography, don't know the Exposure Triangle, understands the mathematics involved, etc., then you will probably will not like this lens. This is not a criticism of the lens.
I am looking forward to using the lens and my first impression is that the image quality will be good and the small size and the lighter weight will be a boon for older shooters like me.
Upate: I took the lens out for a while yesterday and am really pleased with the results. There is definitely a learning curve and I still believe this lens is not for everyone. However, if you know the technical aspects of photography or are willing to learn, this lens is a reasonably priced way to have a long telephoto that did not exist prior to this new lens.

The GF 32-64mm f/4 R LM WR Lens is a standard zoom lens specifically made for the new G Mount and 43.8 x 32.9mm sensor. The GF lens range, which can cope with resolutions up to 100MP, combines the technologies with extensive knowledge accumulated from making XF lenses to provide the best possible image standard and realize the full potential of the new GFX 50S medium format mirrorless camera. The intuitive controls include a C position on the aperture ring, which allows you to adjust the aperture value with the command dial on the camera body. The A (Auto) and C positions are now lockable and all the lenses are weather and dust resistant, plus they can work in temperatures as low as -10 C for worry-free shooting outdoors. Brass mount has been adopted for the strength. This new lens series is set to become a professional workhorse.


review

Recently I upgraded my gear from Canon 5D MK4 to Fujifilm GFX 100S, and this GF 32-64 is the 1st lens I've chosen for GFX100S. It's perfect to be a walkaround lens for everyday life with these pros:
1) Perfect zoom range from 25-51mm (FF equivalent);
2) High quality but very light;
3) Small size that can be easily put inside a tiny camera bag;
4) Fantastic result of sharp, colorful images.
The only shortcoming is that the price is a bit expensive.

Description:::
At its maximum aperture, the Summicron-M 28 mm f/2 ASPH. already delivers impressively rich contrast, differentiated reproduction of even the finest structures, a soft and smooth bokeh and extremely high resolution. This is due to its recalculated optical design, which almost completely eliminates the astigmatic differences in the image field caused by the cover glass of the sensor to ensure excellent image quality from corner to corner in every picture.

Sony's original SMO (Smooth Motion Optics) design and construction minimises optical shifts that can have a negative impact on movie quality. Focus breathing is minimised by an internal focus mechanism, focus shift is eliminated by precise focus tracking adjustment and axial shift is minimised by a constant-length design

The SP 35mm F/1.4 Di USD produces genuinely beautiful bokeh defocus blur both in front of and behind the plane of focus, a characteristic shared with Tamron's legendary 90mm F/2.8 macro lens. The major difference is the fast F/1.4 aperture. Normally, as the lens aperture opens subtle on-axis chromatic aberration appears as color fringe. So we created a countermeasure to thoroughly overcome these deficiencies and produce bokeh that blends in beautifully without introducing aberrant color in front of or behind the focal plane.

The ZEISS Loxia lenses are suitable for use with the mirrorless Sony Alpha cameras with E-mount and were optimized for sensors up to full 35 mm format (24 x 36 mm). With the ZEISS Loxia lenses, the aperture is controlled manually. This allowed the integration of the so-called DeClick feature of the mechanical aperture ring. The cameras feature the corresponding automatic exposure control (A) and manual exposure control (M).
